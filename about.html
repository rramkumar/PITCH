		<h2>About this Program </h2>
		<p> <strong> PITCH </strong> (Personal Intonation Trainer, Computer Heuristics), the <strong>UNC Bands Intonation Trainer, </strong> is designed to help musicians hear pitch discrepancies in real time, as one would need to do while playing in rehearsal or performance.
		</p>
		<p>We are grateful to Robert Spradling, Jay Berger, and Carl Fischer Music for granting permission to use the arrangements from the textbook Error Detection:  Exercises for the Instrumental Conductor.
		</p>
		<p>All of the performances are acoustic recordings of UNC undergraduate musicians that have been auto-tuned in the studio to be in-tune, sharp, or flat.  We used Pro Tools to record tracks, Antares Auto-Tune Live to adjust their pitch, Logic Pro X to mix and master, and Audacity to create the drones. We recommend using headphones for highest fidelity.
		</p>
		<p>On the Home Page, after the user chooses a melody and orchestration the program generates an example with the selected instruments along with a high drone and low drone.  The drones are always in-tune and should be used for reference.  All tracks can be muted or unmuted independently.  
		</p>
		<p>Depending on the selected level one or more voices will be out of tune.  There are four gradations of sharp and four gradations of flat in addition to “in-tune.”  The user must make a choice-- flat, sharp, or in-tune-- for all instruments.  The program defaults to “in-tune.”
		</p>
		<p>Alternatively, the Sandbox Mode allows the user to experiment with combinations of in-tune and out-of-tune for each voice to practice hearing what each possibility sounds like.  
		</p>
		<p> The application used the following five arrangments </p>
